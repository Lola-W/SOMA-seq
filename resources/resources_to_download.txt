Monopogen suggested: http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000G_2504_high_coverage/working/20201028_3202_phased/
However, accroding to the README from 1kGP: "The final and most comprehensive version of the phased panel based on the 3,202 high-coverage 1kGP samples is included in the 20220422_3202_phased_SNV_INDEL_SV/ directory"
We would suggest using: http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000G_2504_high_coverage/working/20220422_3202_phased_SNV_INDEL_SV/
